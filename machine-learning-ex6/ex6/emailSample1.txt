You may have noticed that my business partner Alex Mehr and my company Retail Ecommerce Ventures recently acquired:

Dressbarn
Linens N’ Things
The Book People
The Franklin Mint
...And we’re working on a few more big deals as well.

So many people have been asking me about how they might be able to co-invest with us...

Which is why I’m holding a live Zoom today to discuss a few of the details.

If you’re an accredited investor, make sure to join today’s call:
